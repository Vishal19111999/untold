# Code Guidelines
## Naming Conventions

### jsx
1. The name of jsx file should follow PascalCase.
2. The name of jsx file should be self explanatory to possible extents.

### css

1. The name of a class should start with the name of component followed by a hyphen unless it's parent file is common to multiple components.
2. The name of a css file should match with the name of corresponding jsx file.
3. The length of name of a class should never exceed 4 words.

## Coding Style
1. The react part uses function components and hooks instead of class based components.
2. If an image will be used only by a specific component, it should be put under a folder with name assets under that component's folder instead of common_assets folder.

## Folder Structure
### Client
1. Has 3 folders pages, components and common_assets.
### Server

## Recommended vscode plugins
1. Es7
2. Docker
3. Prettier
4. Any plugin for markdowns
